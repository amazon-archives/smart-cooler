There are two test files:
	test_apicall.js – Demonstrates how to use to make API calls
	test_signonly.js – Demonstrates how to get the signed headers back, does not actually make API call

	2. Install dependencies: "npm install"
	3. To use either file, edit publicKeyId file and privateKey file in the configArgs structure
	4. Run files using "node test_apicall.js" or "node test_signonly.js"
